Hardware
--------

By now, Arma 3 is a fairly old game. As such, most gaming setups you can buy today are more than equipped to handle Arma 3. However, since Arma 3 dynamically loads some of the assets visible in the game and maps are huge, it is important to run Arma 3 from a fast hard drive. The speed of the drive you run Arma 3 from makes a tremendous difference and it cannot be overstated that you should run Arma 3 from a PCIe-connected solid-state disk if you have one available.
